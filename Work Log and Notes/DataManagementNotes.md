- For paywalled data: could possibly create a synthetic dataset to make it publicly available
- For current project, make everything else available but have disclaimer to say that solubity data is not available because it is paywalled
- Naming system WRITTEN DOWN
- Say that whenever running stuff, ran on smaller dataset to check if it works before running the whole thing

Keep track of _how_ data is curated, e.g. commenting code
