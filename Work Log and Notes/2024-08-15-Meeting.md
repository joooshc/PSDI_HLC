# Meeting Notes

- Regenerate HL dataset and figure out why there were random water molecules being added
- Interest in seeing how the models go and how accurate they are
- Find the reliability of HL data (source codes) ->  regenerate with only the measured values as well
- Find range of compounds in HL and logS datasets

for the set of HL data, look at the solubility of those values

Any relationship between HL and logS?

Get overlap between descriptor column names in HL and logS models

FOR PSDI:  

- csv files with data
  - Add SMILES, InChI key, Isomerism flag
- File for logS, HL, Boiling Point
- Separate file for Melting Point

Add comment in presentation about CMC?

Check overlap between melting point, KH, logS

- Send draft report to Samuel Munday
