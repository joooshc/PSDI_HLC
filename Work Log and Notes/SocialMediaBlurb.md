Hi, I'm Josh. I'm about to start my 3rd year at Southampton, studying Chemistry with Digital Methods and Computational Modelling. My internship was on _Modelling Phase Transitions: Characterising Henryâ€™s Law_, and looking at the links between solubility and Henry's Law constant using machine learning methods. Additionally, I completed work curating data for PSDI, looking at boiling and melting points, critical micelle concentration, aqueous solubility, and Henry's law constant.

I really enjoyed working for PSDI and gaining an insight into what it's like to work in an academic research environment. I enjoyed it so much that this is actually my second summer working for them! I've learned a lot of new skills and information, from building neural networks to how to correctly store data and make sure it's FAIR.
