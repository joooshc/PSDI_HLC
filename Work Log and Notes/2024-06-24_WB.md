## 24/06/2024

### Initial meeting with Jo and Jeremy

- Determined that there isn't anything to do to continue on from last year other than get the paper published
  - Paper is going to be given to some bloke named Colin to proof-read
- Assigned and completed task _create a program to detect the number of isomers and give a warning if n>1_
- Introduction to this year's task (Predicting Henry's law constant)

Task notes:  

- What do we actually want to predict? -> Henry's law constant dependence on temperature.
- Relationship between gas dissolving in solution and solid dissolving in solution
  - Solid melting
  - Other phases and stuff

### Work Completed

- Started background research + found some papers to read
- Took a look through links provided by Jeremy
