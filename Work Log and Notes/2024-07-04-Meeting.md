# 2024-07-04 Meeting

## Stuff to Cover

### Updates

- Have extracted data where possible but not joined datasets
- Lots and lots of BP and MP data, but lacking HL (see below)
- Existence of QSPR and semi-empirical methods for calculating HL constant
- Mostly focussing on paper and poster from last year currently

### Henry's Law Dataset

- Viability of using Henry's law dataset
  - 1121 compounds, 3913 datapoints
  - Only contains compounds paired with water
  - A _lot_ of temperature values missing (90%)
- What I'm actually meant to be predicting
- How it's meant to link with Raoult's Law
- CMC data?

### Faraday Conference

Kind of something to discuss with Sami as well further down the line

- Has the invitation actually been replied to
- Who else is going? (Nikki possibly)
- Further information about poster
- Logistics w/accom and transport -> do I need to book and claim back on expenses
- Will my contract be extended for it

### Miscibility Paper

- ML Algorithms explanation section -> delete almost entirely?

### General Questions

- What am I actually meant to be doing with the Henry's Law stuff, especially considering lack of data.

## In Meeting Notes

- CMC data will be sent today
- Raising concentration of solute forms micelles
  - Measure surface tension
- Hansen parameters for the future
- Assume that if temperature not listed, it is 25c
- Logistics and everything will sorted for me (contact Jo, Jeremy, Victoria)
- Contact Sami and Nicola about AI in Chemistry meeting (contact Sami, Nicola, Jeremy, Jo, Victoria)

TO DO:

- Extract CMC data
- Join datasets
- Check correlation between datasets (final size after removing NaN)
- Find log solubility vs log Kh relationship, other constants/features
  - Plot in different dimensions, etc
  - Clustering more than direct correlations 
- Convert mole fractions to LogS
- Big unknown is the properties of the solid
- Analogous to a born haber cycle
