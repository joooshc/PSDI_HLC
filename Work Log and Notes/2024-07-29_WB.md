# Week 6 (29/07/2024 Onwards)

## Results and Stuff so Far

- Data all extracted a long time ago
- Initial results are reasonably good for logH and logS, although error is high for logH and have not tried unscaling it yet
- Models perform better with unscaled data for some reason
- logCMC results and CMC results are poor, need more data ideally
- Tested variety of models

## 29/07/2024

- Improved overfitting presentation plot to actually illustrate what I intended
- Commented code
- Looked at pytorch and ray
- Attended interim presentations

## 30/07/2024

- Attempted to get pytorch to work (had to use previous version of pytorch, otherwise error in importing module)
- Support vector regression

## 31/07/2024

- Grid searches for logS and logCMC and associated updates to code
- Attempting to get Neural Network working.

## 01/08/2024

- Neural network seems to work
- Attended meeting w/Jo

> The idea is to take another step towards characterising phase transitions using machine learning. along with miscibility, solubility, all these involve phase transitions. .. Pure compound phase transitions are usually quite well studied and modelled, using traditional methods. However mixtures are much more complex, and, even for binary mixtures,  there is a huge possible number of combinations, making more traditional methods unfeasible. Hence we are using machine learning, leveraging the wealth of research in to the prediciotn of solubility to expand our understanding of how phase transiitons for mixtures can be modelled..

- Proofread miscibility paper
- Regenerated plots for miscibility paper
- Switched out line of best fit for ideal prediction line
- Neural network optimization

## 02/08/2024

- Learning how to use pytorch ignite to get early stopping
- Started work on report

## Ideas for end project goal

- Create and train logSlogH dataset, use logS to predict missing logH and vice versa
- Do the same for boiling points
- Abandon CMC due to lack of data
- Create melting/boiling point dataset with gaps filled in
- Create logS/logH dataset with gaps filled in
- Add data source column (i.e. predicted with ML, Sander, etc)
