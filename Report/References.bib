  abstract={Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

               engineering, salt formation, solid dispersion, use of
               surfactant, complexation, and so forth. Selection of solubility

The carbonic acid, indeed, is the only gas whose relation to water has been an object of much attention; and, at a very early period of its history, Mr. Cavendish, in the course of inquiries, the results of which were the groundwork of the most important subsequent discoveries, ascertained, with peculiar care, the proportion of carbonic acid gas condensible in water, at the temperature of 55º of Fahrenheit. Dr. Priestley also, about the same period, directed his attention to the saturation of water with fixed air, and contrived a simple and effectual mode of obtaining this impregnation. His apparatus, afterwards, gave way to the more manageable one of Dr. Nooth; and this, in its turn, has been superseded by the improved mode of condensing, into water, many times its bulk of various gases, invented and practised by several chemical artists, (as well as by myself,) both in this country and abroad. The influence of pressure, in accomplishing this strong impregnation, was first, I believe, suggested by Dr. Priestley. “In an exhausted receiver,” that most ingenious philosopher observes, “Pyrmont water will actually boil, by the copious “discharge of its air; and I do not doubt, therefore, that by “means of a condensing engine, water might be much more “highly impregnated with the virtues of the Pyrmont “spring.” }

Water represents a critical nutrient, the absence of which will be lethal within days. Water's importance for the prevention of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases has received more attention recently because of the shift toward consumption of large proportions of fluids as caloric beverages. Despite this focus, there are major gaps in knowledge related to the measurement of total fluid intake and hydration status at the population level; there are also few longer-term systematic interventions and no published randomized, controlled longer-term trials. This review provides suggestions for ways to examine water requirements and encourages more dialogue on this important topic.}",

Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) represent WSPs with common industry and household uses, down-the-drain disposal and a direct route to wastewater treatment plants, conveying high risk of environmental leaching into freshwater ecosystems. The current study is the first investigating the impacts of predicted environmental concentrations of these WSPs on life-history traits of two freshwater species also constituting a disease model (fish - Poecilia reticulata and parasite - Gyrodactylus turnbulli). Single effects of WSPs on fish as well as their interactive effects with infection of the ectoparasite were determined over a 45-day exposure. Generally, WSPs reduced fish growth and increased routine metabolic rate of fish implying a depleted energetic budget, however these effects were dose, exposure time and polymer dependent. Parasitic infection alone caused a significant reduction in fish growth and enhanced fish routine metabolic rate. In contrast, a non-additive effect on metabolic rate was evident in fish experiencing simultaneous infection and WSP exposure, suggesting a protective effect of the two WSPs for fish also exposed to a metazoan ectoparasite. Off-host parasite survival was significantly lowered by both WSPs; however, parasite counts of infected fish also exposed to WSP were not significantly different from the control, implying more complex mechanisms may underpin this stressor interaction. Distinct detrimental impacts were inflicted on both organisms implying environmental leaching of WSPs may be causing significant disruption to interspecies interactions within freshwater ecosystems. Additionally, these results could contribute to sustainable development in industry, as we conclude PVA represents a less harmful alternative to PVP.}

We investigated over 20 years of published solubility datasets and models, highlighting overlooked datasets and the overlaps between popular sets. We benchmarked recently published models on a novel curated solubility dataset and report poor performances. We also propose a workflow to cure aqueous solubility data aiming at producing useful models for bench chemist. Our results demonstrate that some state-of-the-art models are not ready for public usage because they lack a well-defined applicability domain and overlook historical data sources. We report the impact of factors influencing the utility of the models: interlaboratory standard deviation, ionic state of the solute and data sources.

  abstract={The Online Chemical Modeling Environment is a web-based platform that aims to automate and simplify the typical steps required for QSAR modeling. The platform consists of two major subsystems: the database of experimental measurements and the modeling framework. A user-contributed database contains a set of tools for easy input, search and modification of thousands of records. The OCHEM database is based on the wiki principle and focuses primarily on the quality and verifiability of the data. The database is tightly integrated with the modeling framework, which supports all the steps required to create a predictive model: data search, calculation and selection of a vast variety of molecular descriptors, application of machine learning methods, validation, analysis of the model and assessment of the applicability domain. As compared to other similar systems, OCHEM is not intended to re-implement the existing tools or models but rather to invite the original authors to contribute their results, make them publicly available, share them with other users and to become members of the growing research community. Our intention is to make OCHEM a widely used platform to perform the QSPR/QSAR studies online and share it with other users on the Web. The ultimate goal of OCHEM is collecting all possible chemoinformatics tools within one simple, reliable and user-friendly resource. The OCHEM is free for web users and it is available online at http://www.ochem.eu.},

ABSTRACT = {In atmospheric chemistry, the Henry’s law constant (HLC) is crucial for understanding the distribution of organic compounds across gas, particle, and aqueous phases. Quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) models described in scientific research are generally tailored to specific groups or categories of substances and are often developed using a limited set of experimental data. This study developed a machine learning model using an extensive dataset of experimental HLCs for approximately 1100 organic compounds. Molecular descriptors calculated using alvaDesc software (v 2.0) were used to train the models. A hybrid approach was adopted for feature selection, ensuring alignment with the domain knowledge. Based on the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the training and test data after cross-validation, Gradient Boosting (GB) was selected as a model for predicting HLC. The hyperparameters of the selected model were optimized using the automated hyperparameter optimization framework Optuna. The impact of features on the target variable was assessed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The optimized model demonstrated strong performance across the training, evaluation, and test datasets, achieving coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.96, 0.78, and 0.74, respectively. The developed model was used to estimate the HLC of compounds associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) emissions and secondary organic aerosols.},

The SVM concepts presented in Chapter 3can be generalized to become applicable to regression problems. As in classification, support vector regression (SVR) is characterized by the use of kernels, sparse solution, and VC control of the margin and the number of support vectors. Although less popular than SVM, SVR has been proven to be an effective tool in real-value function estimation. As a supervised-learning approach, SVR trains using a symmetrical loss function, which equally penalizes high and low misestimates. Using Vapnik's -insensitive approach, a flexible tube of minimal radius is formed symmetrically around the estimated function, such that the absolute values of errors less than a certain threshold are ignored both above and below the estimate. In this manner, points outside the tube are penalized, but those within the tube, either above or below the function, receive no penalty. One of the main advantages of SVR is that its computational complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space. Additionally, it has excellent generalization capability, with high prediction accuracy.",
